            <br>   
            SEA Admit Weekend is organized each year by UCLA's Southeast Asian Coalition,
            which includes Vietnamese Student Union, Association of Hmong Students, United 
            Khmer Students, Burmese Student Association, Thai Student Association,  
            Association of Indonesian Americans, Southeast Asian Campus Learning Education
            and Retention, and Asian Pacific Coalition. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            SEA Admit Weekend is a student-initiated admit 
            weekend that seeks to educate admitted Southeast Asian high school students 
            about the importance of pursuing higher education and to encourage them to attend UCLA!
            Through this experience, admits receive guidance about how to navigate the college
            experience and what it means to be a Bruin.

       <div id="about2">            
        One staple component of SEA Admit weekend is its POC tour of UCLA, which outlines the 
        impact of people of color on UCLA. By sharing student narratives, this tour seeks to 
        serve as an extension of SEA Admit Weekend's POC tour and help potential incoming SEA 
        students feel at home and feel seen at UCLA.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is our hope that by uplifting accounts by current and former UCLA students, incoming
        SEA students can feel connected to this campus, its spaces, and its Southeast Association
        community spaces.
