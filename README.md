# SEAing-Color
The SEAing Color website allows current UCLA students inside a Southeast Asian (SEA) community to share their personal experiences and stories in addition to mapping out where their stories unfolded. Each story will have a geographical pin in which a person can look at, and every new story can be viewed by scrolling down the main website.

In addition, there are links to multiple resources and cultural organizations that embody the UCLA SEA community. We also created an About page and, for general inquiries, we have an embedded contact sheet that will be reviewed daily in order to ensure the best user experience of our website.

This map is supplementary to the Southeast Asian Admit Weekend festivities, but we hope to make it more personal through a digital landscape.
